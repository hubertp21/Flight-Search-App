# Flight-Search-App
Simple app build to search flights. Enter source, destination and enjoy!
App is build using Maven. It has simple GUI using javaFX and FXML files, database connection provided by MySQL Workbench, mappings made by my own(because hibernate was having some problems :().
The application has also tests made using JUnit and TestFX.
